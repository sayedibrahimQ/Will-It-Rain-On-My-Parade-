Parade Weather 🌦️
AI-powered long-term weather intelligence for event planning, powered by NASA Earth observation data.

Parade Weather is a solution developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025. It transforms decades of NASA satellite data into actionable, long-term weather insights, helping users plan outdoor events with confidence.

📍 The Problem
Standard weather forecasts are reliable for the next 7-10 days, but what if you're planning a wedding, a festival, or a construction project six months from now? Long-term planning becomes a gamble based on vague historical averages. Planners lack the tools to quantify the actual risk of adverse weather like heatwaves, heavy rain, or high winds for a specific future date and location.

✅ Our Solution: Parade Weather
Parade Weather bridges this gap. It's a personalized web application that allows users to pinpoint a location and date to receive a detailed, probabilistic weather outlook. We don't just give you an average temperature; we provide a comprehensive risk assessment and AI-driven advice powered by decades of NASA's historical Earth data, advanced time-series forecasting, and generative AI.

Our solution provides the statistical likelihood of various weather conditions, empowering users to make informed decisions, create contingency plans, and even find the perfect day for their event.

✨ Key Features
📍 Interactive Location Pinpointing: Easily select your event location anywhere on the globe using an interactive map.

📅 Event Day Dashboard: Get a detailed forecast for your chosen day, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and an hourly breakdown.

🤖 AI-Powered "Plan Your Day" Advice: Using Google's Gemini, our app provides personalized recommendations on what to wear and how to plan activities based on the weather profile.

📈 Historical Climate Trends: Visualize how the climate for your specific date and location has changed over the years. Understand if your event date is trending towards being hotter, wetter, or windier.

🚨 Extreme Weather Risk Assessment: See the statistical probability (%) of encountering a heatwave, major rainfall, or high winds in the 30-day window around your event.

🏢 Industry-Specific Advisory: Get tailored advice for different sectors, including Event Planners, Agriculture, and Construction.

🔍 AI-Powered "Perfect Day Finder": Don't have a date yet? Simply input your ideal weather conditions (e.g., mild temperature, calm winds, sunny), and our AI will scan the upcoming months to find the dates with the highest probability of matching your criteria.

🛠️ How It Works (Technical Architecture)
Our system is designed as a robust pipeline that processes user queries to deliver rich, data-driven insights.

User Input: A user selects a location, date, and event type via our intuitive web interface built with a modern frontend framework.

Django Backend: The request is sent to our powerful Django backend, which orchestrates the entire workflow.

Data Retrieval (NASA APIs): The backend queries multiple NASA Earth observation APIs (e.g., POWER, GPM) to fetch decades of historical meteorological data for the specified coordinates. This includes temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, and more.

Time-Series Analysis (SARIMAX): For predictive trends, we employ a SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) model. This statistical model analyzes the historical time-series data to forecast future trends and calculate the probability of certain conditions.

AI Insight Generation (Gemini API): The processed data (historical stats, forecast data, risk probabilities) is passed to the Google Gemini API. We use carefully crafted prompts to:

Synthesize the data into human-readable text.

Generate personalized advice for "What to Wear" and the "Activity Planner."

Create tailored industry-specific recommendations.

Data Visualization: The final data and AI-generated text are sent back to the frontend and displayed in our beautifully designed dashboards and charts.

🏆 NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025
This project is our submission for the "Planning for a Parade" challenge. Our goal was to create a user-friendly tool that leverages the vast repository of NASA's Earth observation data to solve a real-world problem: the uncertainty of long-term event planning. By combining historical data, statistical forecasting, and generative AI, Parade Weather provides a powerful solution that meets and exceeds the challenge's objectives.
